Akka in Action 2nd edition examples in Java

To run an example, go to the appropriate folder and run
`mvn compile exec:exec -Dfile=<name>`
where `<name>` is name of the example you want.
For example if you want to run WalletApp from chapter 2, do:
```
cd up-and-running
mvn compile exec:exec -Dfile=WalletApp
```

I tried to write examples exaclty as they are written in scala.
